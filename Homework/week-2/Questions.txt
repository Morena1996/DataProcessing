Questions:

Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.
Answer: The == operator only compares the values of two variables. It doesn't compare the types	
	of the variables. So if we use the == operator and the statement x==5 returns true, 
	the statement x=="5" will also return true. But the statement x==="5" will return false,
	because the variables have different types.

Explain what a closure is.
Answer: A closure is a function that closes over some local variables. If a function closes over
	a variable from another function, it holds on to the value of that other function long after
	everything else is let go.

Explain what higher order functions are.
Answer: Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions. This can be done by
	taking other functions as arguments or by returning them.

Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that uses a query selector.
Answer:	The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches (a) specified 
	CSS selector(s) in the document. The method only returns the first element that matches
	the specified selectors. This is an effective way to find DOM elements. 
	Example:
	
	function count(selector) {
		return 	document.querySelectorAll(selector).length;
	}

	The method above counts all the elements in the DOM with the specified selector.
