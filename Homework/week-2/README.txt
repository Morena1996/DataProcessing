Week-2: 

I wasn't able to open the pdf with the manual for Github Pages last Friday and I therefore I haven't 
been able to set up my Github Pages right yet. I tried again on Saturday and Sunday but the error
message "Can not load pdf document" kept appearing as I tried to open the manual. 

Also, I do not understand why my KNMI graph website is not working :(.
