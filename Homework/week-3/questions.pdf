1. How can D3 access and change the DOM? What do select and selectAll do?
   Answer: This happens via d3.select. Select accesses the first element that matches the clause.
	   SelectAll() accesses all elements that match the clause.
   
2. What are the d and i in function(d){} and function(d, i){}?
   Answer: The i is an iterative element. It represents the order of the selection. The d is just
	   a convention. It is needed to ensure that something can be done with each element
	   that has been selected by SelectAll().

3. Write sample lines of JavaScript to add a div element with class “barChart1” and to add an 
   svg element with class “barChart2” with square dimensions.
   Answer: d3.select(".barChart1").append(div)
	   d3.select(".barChart2").append("svg").attr("width", 50).attr("height", 50)

4. Describe append, update, enter, and exit at a high level. What does “selectAll + data 
   + enter + append” refer to?
   Answer: Append adds its argument, an html-element, to the selected element (for example: "head").
	   Update, enter and exit can be used to change a dataset dynamically.
	   .update() can be used to change an element.
	   .enter() can be used to create a new DOM element for an added data item, without affecting other elements.
	   .exit() can be used to delete DOM elements without affecting other elements.

5. What are the main differences between drawing a bar chart with HTML and SVG?
   Answer: With SVG you can change the bar chart dynamically, where HTML forces you to hardcode
	   your bar chart.

6. In drawing the simple bar chart with D3 and SVG, what elements were appended, 
   and what parts of the graph did these elements correspond to?
   Answer: A div element. This element corresponded to the six rectangles that represented the data
	   in the bar chart.
